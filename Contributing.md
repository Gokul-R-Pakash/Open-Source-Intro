# Contributing to SSN Coding club

Welcome to SSN Coding Club and thank you for taking the time to read our contributing
guide. This guide is aimed towards first-time contributors and even people who
are new to the concept of Open Source. Carefully read through all the sections but if
you already know some concepts then feel free to skip to a section that
interests you.

## General Contributing Advice

For the most part, if you want to contribute then looking at the [open
issues](https://github.com/ssncodingclub/Open-Source-Intro/issues) is a good place to start.
 For new contributors, the issues labelled
[`good-first-issue`]()
might be a good place to start your contribution from.

In general, issues aren't assigned to anyone as such but, if you are working on
something in an issue then it would make sense to tell us by commenting under
that issue to avoid duplication of any work that may be going on elsewhere.
There are lots of people active on here
and are more than willing to offer you a hand if you ask on an issue or PR. 

## Issue, Feature And PR Template

**When reporting an issue, please be sure to include the following template outlines:**

- A descriptive title for the issue.

- Explain the actual behavior of the issue with enough context and content.

- An isolated way to reproduce the behavior (example: the directory path to the
  code isolated to the issue that anyone can open to observe the problem).

- Screen shots of the issue, if possible should be provided. This would help
  provide visual explanation to your issue.

**When reporting a feature, please be sure to follow below template outlines:**

- A descriptive title for the feature.

- A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including why you think
  this is a problem, and a descriptive overview of the suggested solution.

**When making a PR, follow the below template outlines(check out pr_template.md for more leads):**

- A descriptive title for the PR.

- A descriptive explanation of the PR, if it's a feature or a patch to a
  bug(also provide the link reference to the bug).

- Explain how the patch or feature can be tested.

- Screen shots of the before and after fixing the issue, if it's a bug. This
  would help provide visual explanation to your PR.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

- Click on the Fork button in the top-right corner. This creates a new copy of my demo repo under your GitHub user account with a URL like:
```https://github.com/<YourUserName>/Open-Source-Intro```

- Clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:
```git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/Open-Source-Intro```

- Create a new branch by issuing the command:
```git checkout -b branch_name```

- Create a new remote for the upstream repo with the command:
```git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/Open-Source-Intro```
In this case, "upstream repo" refers to the original repo you created your fork from.Now you can make changes to the code!

- Once you push the changes to your repo, the Compare & pull request button will appear in GitHub

- Open a pull request by clicking the Create pull request button. This allows the repo's maintainers to review your contribution. From here, we can merge it if it is good, or we may ask you to make some changes. Kindly folow the PR Template while submitting the PR.
